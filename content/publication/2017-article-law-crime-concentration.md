abstract = "This paper proposes a new variant of spiking neural P systems (in short, SNP systems), nonlinear spiking neural P systems (in short, NSNP systems). In NSNP systems, the state of each neuron is denoted by a real number, and a real configuration vector is used to characterize the state of the whole system. A new type of spiking rules, nonlinear spiking rules, is introduced to handle the neuronâ€™s firing, where the consumed and generated amounts of spikes are often expressed by the nonlinear functions of the state of the neuron. NSNP systems are a class of distributed parallel and nondeterministic computing systems. The computational power of NSNP systems is discussed. Specifically, it is proved that NSNP systems as number-generating/accepting devices are Turing-universal. Moreover, we establish two small universal NSNP systems for function computing and number generator, containing 117 neurons and 164 neurons, respectively.<br><br>"
