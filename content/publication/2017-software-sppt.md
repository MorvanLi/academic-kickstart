abstract = "[sppt](https://github.com/wsteenbeek/sppt) is an R package that implements several Spatial Point Pattern Tests. The first version of the package started with Martin Andresen's original [Spatial Point Pattern Test](http://www.sfu.ca/~andresen/spptest/spptest.html), but several other functions have been implemented since.<br><br>The tests in this package measure the degree of similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. They are not used for the purpose of testing point patterns with the null hypotheses of random, uniform, or clustered distributions, but may be used to compare a particular point pattern with these distributions. One advantage of the tests is that they can be performed for a number of different area boundaries using the same original point datasets.<br><br>"
