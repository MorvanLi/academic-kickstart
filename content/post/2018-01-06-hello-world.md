I have changed my website from Github Pages + Jekyll to Netlify + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), as recommended by [Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). My new site is powered by the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). For reference purposes, I've kept the original blog posts of the [demo](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/).
