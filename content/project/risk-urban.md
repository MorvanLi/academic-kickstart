Parameters of Risk Across the Urban Landscape (PRAUL) uses data from multiple years on victimizations, crime risk factors, and victimization surveys to analyze these causal links between criminogeneity, fear of crime, and actual crime for the city of Amsterdam. Spatio-temporal clustering and regionalization procedures are used to identify areas of elevated risk and delineate analytical sub-regions that are as homogeneous as possible for the theoretical constructs of interest. These newly defined areas serve as units of analysis to study the interplay between the purported crime risk factors, crime, and the publicâ€™s reaction to crime and policing from a spatio-temporal perspective. The project aims to provide new insights into the relative importance of individual- and area-level causal factors of fear of crime.
