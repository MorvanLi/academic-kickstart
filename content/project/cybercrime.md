Existing theories assume that offenders make rational decisions, but these theories have rarely been tested experimentally. This project uses 'honey accounts', online accounts that have deliberately been rendered vulnerable to hacking, to allow an experimental investigation of cybercriminals' behavior. The research offers unique opportunities for conducting a stringent test of existing criminology theories on offenders' decision-making behavior. This study of offender behavior will broaden our understanding of cybercrime, as previous research has tended to focus on victims and security.
