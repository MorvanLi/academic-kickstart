Why do offenders commit crimes where and when they do? Improving on extant theory and empirical research in the geography of crime, the proposed PhD-research will investigate how offenders' time-specific knowledge of their environment acquired during their daily routines and the time-varying attractiveness of target areas affect offendersâ€™ crime location choices. Combining police-register data on offenders and their offenses with unique data on the locations the offenders frequently visit and data on opening and closing hours of Dutch businesses and facilities, this cutting-edge research project not only advances scientific knowledge, but also contributes to better crime forecasting and urban planning.
